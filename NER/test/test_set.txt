The O

Equation O

However O
in O
actual O

the O

is O
usually O
too O

an O

As O
shown O

when O
we O
train O
a O

much O
more O

Therefore O
we O
should O
preserve O
the O
question O
tokens O
and O
the O
context O
tokens O
as O
contiguous O
sequences O

Specially O
during O
fine-tuning O
we O
propose O
to O
move O
a O
random O
number O

padding O
tokens O
to O
the O
front O

the O

sequence O
as O
shown O

Figure O

We O
do O
not O
move O

during O

and O
just O
feed O
the O
original O

to O
the O

We O
first O
look O
at O
whether O
Random O
Padding MISC
can O
help O

to O
obtain O
better O

of O
rear O

when O
there O
do O
not O

long O

We O
also O
wonder O
how O
Random O
Padding MISC
improves O
QA O
models O

If O
the O
prediction O
of O

obtains O
a O
lower O
F1 O
score O
than O
improved O
model O
we O
will O
compare O
the O
two O

Throughout O

we O
will O
make O
minimal O
assumptions O
about O
the O
underlying O
data O
distribution O
the O
parameterization O
of O
the O
predictor O
and O
the O
(finite) O
dimension O
of O
the O
data O

This O
is O
partly O
a O
matter O
of O
convenience O
but O
partly O
due O
to O
the O
assumption O
that O
the O
written O
form O
of O
language O
is O
the O
canonical O
one O
while O
the O
audio O
modality O
is O
just O
a O
weird O
cumbersome O
encoding O
of O
it O

Here O
I O
outline O
why O
these O
assumptions O
contradicting O
the O
scientific O
view O
are O
not O
only O
incorrect O
but O
also O
detrimental O
to O
progress O
on O
understanding O

Both O

In O

86% O

also O

The O

As O

It O
is O
possible O
that O
we O
do O
not O
use O
an O
“optimal” O
set O
of O
prompts O
as O
we O
did O
not O
mine O
prompts O
or O
perform O
soft O

However O
prompt O
optimality O
itself O
is O
a O
problem O
in O
dialogue O

because O
open-ended O
dialogue O
evaluation O
is O
a O

task O

Instead O
we O
advise O
the O
use O
of O
mixed-initiative O

systems O
in O
a O
supportive O
manner O
eg O
to O
assist O
trained O
counselors O
who O
have O
the O
emotional O
intelligence O
to O
recognize O
what O
content O
may O
be O
hurtful O

We O
hypothesize O
that O
the O
degree O
sequence O
of O
a O
graph O
is O
highly O
correlated O
to O
the O
graph O
structure O
Since O
the O
node O

explicitly O
guide O
the O
generation O
of O
a O

other O
graph O
statistics O
are O
also O
improved O

We O

the O

We O

both O
