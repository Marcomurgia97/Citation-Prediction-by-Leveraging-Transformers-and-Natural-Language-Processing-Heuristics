# Citation-Prediction-by-Leveraging-Transformers-and-Natural-Language-Processing-Heuristics

Implementation of the project described in the paper Citation-Prediction-by-Leveraging-Transformers-and-Natural-Language-Processing-Heuristics.

This repo contains code for automating the citation prediction problem using transformers and related experiments for performance evaluation.

## Prerequisites
You can download the models we use and fine-tuned from the following links

The experiments were carried out on windows 11, using python 3.9.13 (anaconda prompt)

To replicate the experiments it's necessary to install anaconda prompt and have an nvidia gpu supporting CUDA

## Installing
Steps are the following:

Clone the repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/Marcomurgia97/Citation-Prediction-by-Leveraging-Transformers-and-Natural-Language-Processing-Heuristics.git
```

move into the repo:
```
cd Citation-Prediction-by-Leveraging-Transformers-and-Natural-Language-Processing-Heuristics
```
Open the anaconda prompt and create the virtual environment:
```
virtualenv venv
```
then:
venv\Scripts\activate
